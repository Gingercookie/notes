# Notes
This repo exists to organize all of my notes in a central, organized place.

Most of the notes here are high level overviews of different kinds of
vulnerabilities, and some mitigation strategies for them.

There are also general notes on other topics, including different
laws and regulations that financial institutions must adhere to, pertaining to
infosec and privacy.

#### Terminal Settings
The following files are archived together into `terminal_preferences.tar`
- `.p10k.zsh`
- `.zshrc`
- `com.googlecode.iterm2.plist`

#### AppSec
Notes from a past live, organized into a single place. Go here if you forget what XSS or XXE means.

#### CKA
Notes related to Kubernetes. Specifically, the Certified Kubernetes Administrator exam.

#### GCP
Notes related to GCP, including cloud armor and security command center.

#### SEC401
This folder includes notes that I took as part of SANS SEC 401 training course,
and is probably the most complete set found here.

The course teaches the contents of the GIAC GSEC certification.

The notes are more or less taken as content is presented, with no real cleanup
or organization after the fact. Notes are split up by day.

#### Pluralsight CEH Notes
- Reconnaissance
- Session Hijacking
