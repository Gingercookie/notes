# Notes
This repo exists to organize notes in a central, organized place.

#### AppSec
Notes from a past life, organized into a single place. Go here if you forget what XSS or XXE means.

Also moved all the SANS training course notes (if you can call them notes) under this folder.

#### CKA
Notes related to Kubernetes. Specifically, the Certified Kubernetes Administrator exam.

#### GCP
Notes related to GCP, including cloud armor and security command center.

#### Terminal Settings
Terminal settings, and useful commands, etc have been moved to dotfiles. 
The way I decide where to put a file / note is by answering the question "Will I want to clone this info to a work computer"?
If I do, then it goes in dotfiles. If it's just notes that I can read online, and don't need a local copy here, it goes here.
