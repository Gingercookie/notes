# Module 1 - AWS

### The AWS Well-Architected Framework
There are 5 pillars of the WAF
- Security
- Reliability
- Cost Optimization
- Performance Efficiency
- Operational Excellence

### Availability Zones
- Currently there are 18 regions worldwide
- Made of one or more data centers
- Connected with other zones over private links
- You can choose your zone, and AWS recommends replicating across zones

### AWS Regions
Each region is made up of two or more availability zones.

You are automatically allowed to use all the availability zones except for the ones in mainland china (Beijing and Ningxia).

There are also two "AWS GovCloud" regions (US-West and US-East) meant for US government and other customers who have more sensitive data.
