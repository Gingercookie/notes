Port Scanning
-------------

Port scanning works because most services run on standard, documented ports.

The easiest way to scan for services is to establish a TCP connection on every
port, but this is noisy and detectable, and usually leaves a trace (IP logs).

Types of scans

SYN Scan
A syn scan simply sends SYN packets to each port on a system. This is less
noisy than a full tcp connection, and doesn't get logged because the connection
is never established. It is also called a half-open scan, because the client
never responds with an ACK to finalize the handshake.

You can run a syn scan through nmap with -sS option

FIN, Xmas, NULL scans
In order to mitigate the effects of a SYN scan, new tools were created to detect
half-open connections. In order to get around this, we send nonsensical packets
and see how the port responds. If there is no response, there is typically no
service running there. If a response is sent, it's an indication that a service
is running on that port.

FIN expects a RST packet in response, but Microsoft's implementation of TCP
fails to do this, so FIN scans aren't always reliable.
    -sF

Xmas scan is a packet with FIN, URG, PSH flags all turned on
    -sX

NULL scan is a packet with no flags
    -sN
