TLS - transport layer security. SSL (secure sockets layer) is technically a
    misnomer for TLS as SSL is actually the predecessor to TLS.
    Based on SSLv3. It is a layer 4 (transport) security measure. It runs 
        directly on top of TCP only.
    TLS/SSL operates on public/private key pairs in the PKI to manage 
        certificates. Because of this, both the client and server must
        have technology to cryptographically verify keys and certificates.
    TLS ONLY provides point-to-point encryption, NOT end-to-end encryption.

IPsec - Internet Protocol security
    Protocol suite that runs on layer 3 (network layer). 
    There are two main protocols used in IPsec:
        Authentication Header (AH) - used to provided authentication.
        Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) - used to provide 
            both authentication and confidentiality of data (payload).
    Because IPsec is used at layer  3, this means it provdes support for
        any kind of layer 4 and above protocol (tcp,udp,icmp,dns).
    Does not rely on public key crypto, so it is much less demanding.
    Does not play nice with NA(P)T. Because the layer 4 ports are now 
        encrypted (in ESP), it makes it tough to read them and be able to
        redirect to the proper host.
