CSMA/CD
    Carrier sense multiple access / collision detection
    layer 2

Dedicated lines
    end-to-end links leased from a carrier company (ATT, Sprint, Orange, etc)
    These are typically T1, T3, E1, E3
    Costly

Frame Relay
    sharing a WAN with others, pay per packet (bandwidth)
    least expensive non-dial-up connection is a 64kbps frame relay
        POS, rural, etc..

MPLS
    multiprotocol label switching
    called "multiprotocol" because it encapsulates other protocols/layers
        similar to TLS, SSH (..?)

ISDN, DSL, Cable Modems
    Internet connection established over phone lines, etc...
    These are a huge security concern as they are typically installed
        as rogue lines, backdoors into a company to bypass security controls
        when "convenient"

Networking Hardware
    Hub
        layer 2
        broadcast (repeat), easy to sniff
    Bridge
        layer 2
        forwards frames based on mac address
    Switch
        layer 2
        smart forwarding based on mac addresses
    Router
        layer 3 device
        connects logical networks
        makes decisions based on ip and ports
        drops traffic if it doesn't know where to send it (unlike layer 2 devices)

802.1X Network-level authentication
    VLANs
    NAC (network access control)
        Isolates a system before put on the network, allows for scanning,
        fingerprinting, etc, before being put on the network

9, 10, 13 ICMP type code (rejected)

SEQ # : next byte I expect to receive from you
ICANN maintains official list of port numbers
