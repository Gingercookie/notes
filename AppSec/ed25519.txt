Anybody who claims that he knows what computers will be ablet odo more than 50 years from now is either a prophet, a madman, a liar, or all of these together.

There is no meaningful way to compare 3000-bit and 4000-bit RSA keys, in a
    security view. They are both unbreakable in the foreseeable future.

In SSH, two algorithms are used.
    The first, Diffie-Hellman (or the elliptic curve variant called ECDH),
    is used to generate a "shared key". This key is the key that will be 
    used to encrypt and decrypt data for the session.

    The second algorithm, based on a public/private key pair, is used only
    to authenticate the identity of the client/server.

DH is a key-exchange algorithm based on integer factorization (factoring a
    given modulus).
ECDH (elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman) is based on discrete logarithm problem.
Elliptic curve cryptography, as a general practice, provides more security
    per bit than does integer factorization.

Ed25519 was NOT developed by the NSA, who has been known to produce 
    cryptographically weak standards (see DUAL_EC_DRBG).

Ed25519 keys are generally 256 bits (at least mine are), and are believed
    to be more secure than 4096-bit RSA keys. The major downfall of the keys
    being that they are not widely used.
