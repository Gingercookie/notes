Windows Day

Alternate Data Streams
	It's a feature, not a bug! - Microsoft
	You can hide data behind other data. It has legitimate uses, but it also allows
	you to hide executables behind files. If you find an executable ADS, it's
	likely malware

Access Control
	Security Access Token contains Security Identifier

	Local access control is cumulative
	Remote access control is "most-restrictive wins" between NTFS and remote ACL

	Denies
		Implicit Deny
			If a user has not explicitly been given permission to acess a resource, they
			are denied implicitly
		Explicit Deny
			It is possible to explicitly deny permission to a user or a group 
			If an user is explicitly denied, or belongs to a group that is explicitly
			denied, that deny overwrites any other permission he may have

Registry
	Keeps a record of every timestamp of every file accessed, program run, etc..
	Remote regedit exists, turn it of..

	Registry Editing Templates
		SecEdit

Mandatory Integrity Control (MIC)

"Whole-disk" (Most of the disk) Encryption 
	Can't encrypt the boot sector, obviously...

	Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
		Includes cpu and storage
		Keys are stored here
		Crypto functions are performed here
		Not an asic, buts it's really fast, and it will self-destruct

	Bitlocker 
		Don't try and use bitlocker without a TPM
		Can use a 48-digit password to decrypt without TPM or USB/PIN, etc..

Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)
	Fuckin' blows
	Replaces BIOS

	Secure boot is a main feature
	Can load antivirus software at the earliest point possible

Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
	
Account Management
	Guest
		Enable the guest account
		Set a yuuuge password on it
		Set the permissions to 0
		Disable the account
	Administrator
		Rename administrator account to something inconspicuous
		Create a new honeypot account "Administrator"

Hardening IIS

Port Numbers
	...nevermind

IPSec can be used for encryption and to shape traffic

Wow windows sucks.
