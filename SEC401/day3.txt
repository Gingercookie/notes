ROI
	(%) ROI  = (gain - expenditure)/expenditure

Cookies
	Created by Netscape
	Originally created for very small purposes (session tracking, etc..)
	Now used for everything

SSL/TLS
	Created by Netscape until SSLv3, then handed off to IETF
	IETF created TLSv1.0(SSLv4)+

Securing WebApps
	Input validation
		injection attacks 

Firewalls
	not deep packet insepction
		only looks at headers 
	deep packet inspection
		looks at headers plus data portion

	stateful inspection
		list of rules AND state table
			state table creates new entries when it sees a new, valid packet that 
			matches a permit rule

			When any other packet as part of that connection hits the firewall, it
			mathches with the state table instead of the rule list

			When the firewall sees a FIN as part of the connection, the state table
			entry is deleted and a new connection would start this process all over 
			again

			State table matching happens in the kernel, and is faster than matching
			all packets to rules. 

	Proxy Gateway
		They're real inefficient, and really, really inefficient for UDP
		(because they have to copy and forward traffic between buffers)

		two separate connections are made, the connection on each side mirrors the other

	Data Diode
		physically incapable of sending data in two directions. Can only receive data

	Unidirectional Gateway
		software solution that only allows connections to be established in one way,
		but will allow responses 

	NAT
		Port translation

Honeypots & Honeynets
	honeypots are cool, but do everything else first

	they don't inherently give you much (if any) security, so the effort is almost
	always better spent somewhere that does

Intrusion Detection/Prevention System
	IDS
		True Positive : attack triggered alert
		True Negative : attack did not trigger alert
		False Positive: non-attack triggered alert
		False Negative: non-attack did not trigger alert

10 I.P.s with most connections
10 I.P.s with longest connection
10 I.P.s with most data transferred
