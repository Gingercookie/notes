Cross-site Scripting (xss) attacks are a type of code injection. They occur
when the server does not validate user input.

Two different types of xss:

Reflected (non-persistent):
    In a reflected xss attack, part of the URL contains a string which is 
        then copied into the server's HTTP(S) response and then displayed
        back to the user. If this input is not validated, it can create
        a vulnerability where a user can execute arbitrary javascript on the
        server. 
    The most common form of this attack is creating a malicious URL with
        the xss attack embedded inside, and then giving the URL to a user
        to follow. When the user clicks the link, the attack will be sent
        to the server, and then reflected back to the user from the server.

Persistent:
    This occurs when a data sent by the user is saved on the server and 
        subsequently served to other users in a normal request.
    Example: A website where users are allowed to edit content for other
        people to view (facebook, for example). If you edit some text
        on your page to include a <script> tag, then you can store 
        arbitrary javascript inside that page. When other users come to
        visit your page, the script will be executed on their browser.
        This can be used to get personal information from the users who 
        are visiting your page.
