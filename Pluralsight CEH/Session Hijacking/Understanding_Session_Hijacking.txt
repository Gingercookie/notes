What is session hijacking?

TA gets in the stream between client and server and does some malicious things

#types
Two main levels of session hijacking:
Application-level hijacking
	This is usually in reference to a HTTP connection.
	There are multiple variants of this kind of attack:
		Session ID sniffing - attacker obtains session ID the user is using
		Session fixation - attacker provides session ID to user and pulls data
		Session donation - forge a profile and give the whole session and 
			profile to user.
		Session ID brute force - guess a valid session ID of a user and see if
			any of them work.

Network level hijacking
	This is a lot less common than application level hijacking
	This generally refers to TCP connections
		Blind hijacking - TA inserts himself into the connection by guessing
			the sequence number of the next TCP packet
		Session sniffing - just sniff out the session ID inside the tcp packet
		IP spoofing - change your IP
		UDP hijacking - could potentially be protocol other than TCP

#vectors
Attack vectors that allow session hijacking to occur:
Man-in-the-middle attacks
	over wifi hotspot
	dns spoofing

Man-in-the-browser
	malware or trojan installed on host machine
	malicious browser add-on

Brute forcing
	enumerating session IDs

Cross-site scripting
	social-engineering to get users to click on link, which can be hijacked

Session ID leakage
	referrer in outbound links (referrer header in HTTP)
	exposed log files

#impact
What is the impact of session hijacking? What goes wrong? :
The victim is impersonated by the hacker
	The impact of this depends on what the user is allowed to do on the server
	or web application on which he is authorized

What is the system designed to do?
What can a legitimate user do on the system?

Session hijacking is the second most important application-level vulnerability

Why is it the second most important?
The prevalence : widespread
	This is found very commonly throughout the web
The impact : severe
	The TA is allowed to do anything that a legitimate user is allowed to do
