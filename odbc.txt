Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)
---------------------------------

ODBC is an API for accessing a data source from within a programming language
(that is, programmatically). A data source is typically a database management
system (DBMS), but can be something else, like a text file, or CSV file. 

Because multiple different kinds of DBMSs exist, and each has its own 
language, each DBMS needs its own ODBC drvier to translate between the two
formats. The driver will take a query from the standard ODBC format and
translate it into the correct syntax and language for a specific DBMS. Once
the request has been processed, ODBC will take the response from the DBMS and
translate it back into the standard format, which is then fed back into the 
program.

The API translates DBMS queries and translates them to a native
